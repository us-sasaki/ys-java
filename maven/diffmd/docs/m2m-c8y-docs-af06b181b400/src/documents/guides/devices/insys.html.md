## Overview

All [INSYS icom](http://www.insys-icom.com/) industrial routers and condition monitors support the automatic data transmission from monitored PLC or other devices to the Cumulocity Cloud. This is realised by the so called Monitoring App, an upgrade to the standard firmware of INSYS icom. The app allows an easy and efficient monitoring of Siemens LOGO!TM and S7 controls as well as Modbus TCP/RTU devices. Measurements, events and alarms can be transmitted to the Cumulocity Cloud. All available data can be directly setup in the Monitoring App and are automatically provided to the cloud account for (automatically self-scaling) charts and lists. With one INSYS icom device several PLCs can be monitored in parallel. The transmission of the data to several cloud accounts is also possible. In case of Cumulocity is not available, data can be processed or stored on the INSYS icom device in the meantime.

The following devices support Cumulocity:

* [IMON series](http://insys-icom.com/IMON): Condition Monitors
* [EBW series](http://insys-icom.com/EBW): Basic Industrial Routers
* [MoRoS series](http://insys-icom.com/MoRoS): All-round Industrial Routers
