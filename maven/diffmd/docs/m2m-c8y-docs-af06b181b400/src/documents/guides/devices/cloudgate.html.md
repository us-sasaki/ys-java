## Installation

After setting up the CloudGate device, make sure to have the latest firmware installed. To install firmware on your CloudGate device, you can either register your CloudGate to the Option provisioning server or you can upload it manually. In both cases you have to [create an account](https://cloudgateuniverse.com/) first.

For upgrading your CloudGate remotely:

- Log in at [CloudGate Universe](https://cloudgateuniverse.com/).
- Go to the "Devices" tab.
- Before activating a new device, you need to create a new group first. Click on "New group" and fill out the form.
- After creating a group, click on "Activate new device" and fill out the form.
- Navigate to your device and click on the button "Change version" in the "Firmware" section.
- Select the version you intend to install on your CloudGate device and click on "Apply changes".

![CloudGate](/guides/devices/cloudgate/change_firmware.png)

For upgrading your CloudGate manually:

- Log in at [CloudGate Universe](https://cloudgateuniverse.com/).
- Go to the "Library" tab.
- Click on "View firmware" in the "Firmware" section.
- Go to the firmware matching your device type and click "View details".
- Click on the download icon next to the version you intend to install.
- Access your CloudGate device via web browser.
- Log into the CloudGate web interface. The default username and password are both admin.

![CloudGate web interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/device_provisioning.png)

- Go to the "Provisioning" tab and in the left menu select "Upload device provisioning file".
- Click on "Browse..." and navigate to the zip archive.
- Click upload and wait for the file to be sent.

After the device restarted, you can confirm the firmware version by checking the web interface of the CloudGate device.

![CloudGate Universe](/guides/devices/cloudgate/firmware_version.png)

To connect your CloudGate device with Cumulocity, the "LuvitRED" plugin needs to be installed as well. Follow the instructions above. In this case the plugin can be found in the "Application" section and not in the "Firmware" section.

If you upgrade your CloudGate device remotely, it will automatically check for updates. To be precise, if the version which is installed on your CloudGate device differs from the version specified in your [CloudGate Universe](https://cloudgateuniverse.com/) account, the device will automatically download and install the version specified in your account. This is useful if you have to perform a factory reset on your device which would reset the firmware on the device. Therefore, you should always make sure that the newest version is selected in your account.

## LuvitRED Overview

LuvitRED is a browser-based application which allows you to write applications without any programming language. With the help of an editor, you can easily create workflows by utilizing a set of nodes which perform certain tasks respectively.

To view the LuvitRED editor, go to the "Plugin" tab in the CloudGate web interface and select "LuvitRED". Click on "Advanced Editor" and the editor will appear.

![LuvitRED user interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/luvitred.png)

On the left side of the user interface, you can see a list of nodes which are ready to use. To see which purpose the node serves, click on a node and see the description on the right side. Drag a node into the middle area to add it to your current workflow. Before creating a workflow, you have make sure that your device is connected to the CloudGate, otherwise the workflow will not work. In a similar manner, you have to include at least one "c8y" node in your workflow in order to connect to Cumulocity. Type "c8y" into the search bar to view all the nodes which are related to Cumulocity. Adding one of the following "c8y" nodes brings the following features:

* [c8y measurement](#measurement): Sends a measurement to the Cumulocity server
* [c8y alarm](#alarm): Sends an alarm to the Cumulocity server
* [c8y event](#event): Sends an event to the Cumulocity server
* [c8y command](#command): Receives a command sent by the Cumulocity server
* [c8y config](#config): Receives a configuration update sent by the Cumulocity server
* [c8y response](#response): Sends a response to commands to the Cumulocity server

> Note that nodes in LuvitRED which require the user to write code (e.g. the "function" node) use Lua as a programming language.

## Using LuvitRED with Cumulocity: An Example

### Basic workflow

In general, a node can have an input and/or output depending on the functionality. Two nodes can be connected by linking the output of one node with the input of another node. A dialog for configuring the node will appear when double-clicking it. After configuring the nodes, the workflow is ready to be deployed. Click on the "Deploy" button in the top right corner to start the workflow. If there are changes in the configuration which have not been deployed yet, a blue dot will appear above the node. If there is at least one parameter in the configuration which has to be specified but is not, a red triangle will appear above the node.

In the following example, the "inject" and "debug" node will be used. Drag both nodes into the middle area and connect them by clicking on the output of the "inject" node", holding the mouse and releasing it above the input of the "debug" node.

![LuvitRED user interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/basicflow.png)

The "debug" node is used for displaying the input it gets on the console (the "debug" tab on the right side of the editor) while the "inject" node is used for sending a customizable value as output. In this case, the "debug" node will just display the value we will configure in the "inject" node. To configure the "inject" node, double-click it.

![LuvitRED user interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/injectdialog.png)

- Payload: Defines what will be sent as output.
  - Select "string" as the type of the payload in the drop-down menu.
  - Enter "test" as payload.
- Repeat: Specifies when the payload will be sent.
  - Check "Fire once at start".
- Name: Defines the name of the node which will be displayed in the user interface.
  - Enter an arbitrary name.

After deploying the changes, you should be able to see the specified value in the "debug" tab.

![LuvitRED user interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/debug.png)

### Basic workflow with Cumulocity

In the following example, we will simulate a periodic temperature measurement and send it to Cumulocity. To do so, replace the "debug" node with a "c8y measurement" node.

![LuvitRED user interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/basiccumulocityflow.png)

To send random numeric values perdiodically, change the configuration of the "inject" node. First, select "random integer" as payload type and choose a range of possible values. Second, select "interval" in the "repeat" field and specify an interval.

![LuvitRED user interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/basiccumulocityflowinjectdialog.png)

Next, the "c8y measurement" node needs to be configured.

![LuvitRED user interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/basiccumulocityflowmeasurement.png)

- Type: Type of the measurement.
  - Enter "c8y_Temperature" as type.
  - Select "Temperature" in the drop-down menu. A predefined fragment will be created depending on the selection.
  - Click on the "add" button.

- Platform: Defines the platform the node will use.
  - Click on the "pencil" icon. Another dialog which represents the "c8y platform" node will appear.

![LuvitRED user interface](/guides/devices/cloudgate/basiccumulocityflowplatform.png)

- Provision: Defines if the credentials will be set manually or autoprovisioned.
  - Select "Manually" in the drop-down menu.
- Tenant: The tenant you want to register your device at.
  - Enter the tenant name.
- Username: The username which will be used for authentication.
  - Enter your username.
- Password: The password which will be used for authentication.
  - Enter your password.
- Name: Defines the name of the node which will be displayed in the user interface.
  - Enter an arbitrary name.

For more information on the "[c8y measurement](#measurement)" and "[platform](#platform)" node, see below.

After configurating the "c8y measurement", the workflow is ready to be deployed. You should be able to see the measurements sent by the device in the "Measurement" tab of your device in the "Device Management" application of Cumulocity. You can also see the amount of measurements which were sent in the status under the node.

For more information on the node, refer to the description which can be seen on the "Info" tab on the right side when selecting the node.

### <a name="platform"></a>"c8y platform" node

This node is not visible in the list of nodes as it is used as a configuration which can be shared by multiple nodes. The configuration node defines the type of connection and the credentials which will be used to communicate with Cumulocity.

![c8y platform](/guides/devices/cloudgate/c8yplatform.png)

To be able to use the configuration, the type of provision has to be specified ("Manually" or "Automatically").

In case of "Manually", the user has to enter a tenant, username and password. After starting the workflow, the nodes which use this configuration should be able to connect to Cumulocity, provided that the credentials are correct.

In case of "Automatically", the user can enter a servername and authentication string. If not, the node will use default values. Before or after starting the workflow, the user has to register the device with its serial number in the desired tenant. For more information on registering devices, refer to "[Connecting devices manually](/guides/users-guide/device-management/#device-registration)". After accepting the device in the tenant, the nodes which use this configuration should be able to connect to Cumulocity, provided that the credentials are correct.

## LuvitRED example

The following example workflow is a bit more complex but shows a possible use case. Imagine that you have a device which measures the temperatures and publishes the measurements via MQTT. With the help of the "MQTT" node in LuvitRED, we are able to subscribe to the channel the measurements are published on.

![c8y platform](/guides/devices/cloudgate/luvitred_example_mqtt_publisher.png)

After the measurement was received, the "json" node converts the input to JSON format. Then the "switch" node decides to which node it will forward the input to depending on a user-defined condition. In this case, if the temperature is above a certain threshold, an alarm will be sent. Otherwise, a measurement will be sent to Cumulocity.

If you do not have a device which supports MQTT, you can use this workflow instead to simulate such a device.

![c8y platform](/guides/devices/cloudgate/luvitred_example_mqtt_subscriber.png)

This workflow uses two "inject" nodes to simulate a measurement which triggers either the "c8y measurement" node or the "c8y alarm" node in the other workflow.

## Import/Export LuvitRED flows

To facilitate the reuse of workflows LuvitRED offers the possibility to import/export workflows.

### Export LuvitRED flows

To export your workflows, you can either use the LuvitRED or Cumulocity user interface.

If you want to use the LuvitRED user interface

* Click on the icon in the top right corner to open the menu.
* Go to the menu item "Export".
* Select "File - All nodes".
* Choose a name for your JSON file.
* Click on the "OK" button.

If you want to use the Cumulocity user interface, you have to make sure that one of your workflows contains a "c8y" node with a correctly configured "c8y platform" configuration node. Moreover, the "Flow deploy ?" checkbox needs to be checked in this "c8y platform" configuration node.

* Navigate to your CloudGate device in the "Device Management" application.
* Open the "Configuration" tab.
* Click on the "Get new snapshot from device" button.
* After the command successfully completed, you can find the JSON file in the "Configuration repository" menu.

> Note that if there is no correctly configured "c8y platform" configuration node in your workflows, Cumulocity will not be able to communicate with the device and therefore will not be able to retrieve the JSON file.

> Note that when a "c8y platform" configuration node contains credentials (usernames and passwords), these are not exported via the LuvitRED editor.

### Import LuvitRED flows

To import your workflows, you can either use the LuvitRED or Cumulocity user interface.

If you want to use the LuvitRED user interface

* Click on the icon in the top right corner to open the menu.
* Go to the menu item "Import".
* Select "From File".
* Click on the "Choose a file" button.
* Navigate to the JSON file you want to import and select it.
* Click on the "OK" button.

If you want to use the Cumulocity user interface, you have to make sure that one of your current workflows contains a "c8y" node with a correctly configured "c8y platform" configuration node. Moreover, the "Flow deploy ?" checkbox needs to be checked in this "c8y platform" configuration node. When importing, your current workflows will be replaced with the workflows in the JSON file so make sure to save workflows that are not to be replaced, too.

* Navigate to your CloudGate device in the "Device Management" application.
* Open the "Configuration" tab.
* Go to the "Apply new snapshot" section and select the JSON file you want to import in the drop-down menu.
* Click on the "Put new snapshot to device" button.
* After the command successfully completed, refresh the LuvitRED tab in your browser. You should be able to see the imported workflows now.

> Note that if there is no correctly configured "c8y platform" configuration node in one of your current workflows, Cumulocity will not be able to communicate with the device and therefore will not be able to push the JSON file onto the device.

The workflows should start automatically as soon as they are imported which means that it is not necessary to deploy them, provided that the "c8y platform" configuration node(s) in your imported workflows were configured correctly.
