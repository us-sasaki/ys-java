## Overview

The StratusConnect™ MC Gateway from Red Lion Controls is an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-ready product that enables organizations to seamlessly connect disparate equipment – across multi-vendor environments – to the cloud. Whether devices are from ABB, Mitsubishi, Rockwell, Schneider Electric, Siemens or other vendors, our StratusConnect™ MC Gateway combines built-in protocol conversion with an embedded Cumulocity agent to quickly connect devices to the cloud and monitor data within minutes and not days.

Use the StratusConnect™ MC Gateway to take advantage of the many benefits of the IIoT by leveraging:
* The Cumulocity Cloud for secure data access
* Easy-to-use Crimson® software
* Comprehensive 300+ driver library to simultaneously convert up to 15 protocols
* RS-232, RS-485 and Ethernet ports to connect legacy and new equipment
* Modular design to meet any communication or I/O requirement

## Configuration and connecting to Cumulocity

Quickly setup protocol conversion, data mapping and visualization in four simple steps:
1. Use Red Lion’s free Crimson 3.0 software to select industrial protocols from a library of over 300 drivers
2. Create new or import data tags from all connected equipment
3. Configure StratusConnect™ MC Gateway using Cumulocity credentials
4. Drag-and-drop tags to push data to the Cumulocity Cloud
