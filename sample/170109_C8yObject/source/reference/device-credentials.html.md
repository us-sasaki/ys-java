The device credentials interface consists of the following parts:

* Device requests are used to register new devices with a tenant.
* Device credentials provide credentials to registered devices.
* Device credentials provide endpoint to bulk credentials provision.

For more information on the process of registering devices, see the Section "[Devices integration](/guides/rest/device-integration#step-0-request-device-credentials)".

> Note that for all PUT/POST requests accept header should be provided, otherwise an empty response body will be returned.

## Device credentials

Device credentials can be enquired by devices that do not have credentials for accessing a tenant yet. Since the device does not have credentials yet, a set of fixed credentials is used for this API. The credentials can be obtained by contacting [support](https://support.cumulocity.com). Do not use your tenant credentials with this API.

## <a name="creds-upload"></a>Bulk device credentials

Device credentials and device representation can be provided from CSV file. CSV file must have 2 sections.

First section is the first line of csv file. This line contains column names (headers):

|Name|Occurs|Description|
|:---|:---|:----------|
|ID|1|The external id of a device|
|CREDENTIALS|1|Password for the device's user|
|TENANT|0..1|The name of tenant for which registration is executed (allowed only by management tenant)|
|TYPE|0..1|The type of device representation|
|NAME|0..1|The name of device representation|
|ICCID|0..1|The iccid of device (sim card number). If 'iccid' appers in file, import adds a fragment 'c8y_Mobile.iccid'. 'Iccid' value is not mandatory for each row, please see below example of http request|
|IDTYPE|0..1|The type of external Id. If 'idtype' doesn't appear in file, the default value is used. The default value is 'c8y_Serial'. 'Idtype' value is not mandatory for each row, please see below example of http request|
|PATH|0..1|The path in the groups hierarchy where device is added. Path contains name of each group separated by '/', i.e: Main group/Subgroup/.../Last subgroup. If group doesn't exists, import creates the group|
|SHELL|0..1|If this column contains value 1, import adds for device 'Shell' feature (specifically: c8y_SupportedOperations fragment). 'Shell' value is not mandatory for each row, please see below example of http request|

Section two is the rest of csv file. Section two contains devices information. Order and quantity of values must be the same like order and quantity of headers.

Separator is automatically obtained from CSV file. Valid separator values are: '\t - tabulation mark', '; - semicolon' and ', - comma'.

CSV file can appear in many forms (regarding to optional tenant column and occurrence of device information):
* when user is logged as management tenant, then columns: 'id', 'credentials' and 'tenant' are mandatory, and credentials for device will be created for tenant mentioned in 'tenant' column,
* when user is logged in as 'not management' tenant i.e. sample_tenant, then columns: 'id' and 'credentials' are mandatory (if file contains 'tenant' column, it is ignored and credentials for device will be created for tenant that is logged in),
* when user wants to add information about device, columns 'type' nad 'name' must appear in csv file,
* when user wants to add information about sim card number, columns 'type', 'name' and 'iccid' must appear in csv file,
* when user wants to change the type of external id, columns 'type', 'name' and 'idtype' must appear in csv file,
* when user wants to add device to group, columns 'type', 'name' and 'path' must appear in csv file,
* when user wants to add shell feature, columns 'type', 'name' and 'shell' must appear in csv file and column 'shell' must contain value 1.
